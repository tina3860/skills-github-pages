Analyzed survey responses from 1,500 remote workers in NSW (2020 & 2021) to capture shifts in work-from-home experiences, productivity metrics, and demographic trends by cleaning and merging disparate datasets.  

Evaluated key factors—including time use, mental health, and business perceptions—to identify barriers and benefits of remote work, highlighting challenges such as isolation and collaboration inefficiencies.

Developed strategic, actionable recommendations to guide organizations in implementing effective remote/hybrid work policies that optimize productivity and enhance employee well-being.
